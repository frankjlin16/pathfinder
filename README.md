# Algorithmic AI Pathfinder

## Description

The goal of this project is to create a web application using **React** and **Tailwind CSS** to render a pathfinding simulation UI with different types of algorithms. This UI will allows users to move the starting node and the end node on a grid system which defines where the pathfinding algorithm would start and end. The user can also choose which algorithm they would like to see in action. Lastly, the user can click a button to generate a maze or draw a maze on the “map” or grid system to create a challenge for the pathfinder.
